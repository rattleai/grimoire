# Rattle onboarding — the day-0 bootstrap

Every other skill in this bundle assumes a tenant that **already has products**. `rattle-ingest` maps a pricelist onto entities that must exist. `rattle-suggest-config` reuses groups it expects to find. `rattle-audit` scans a catalogue. **Nobody walks the path from an empty tenant to a working configurator.** This skill is that path.

The audience is a **new Rattle customer (tenant admin)** on their first day. The output is a tenant that is *correctly ordered* — because the order is not obvious, several of the steps are irreversible in practice, and getting them wrong is silent.

Onboarding **writes to a live tenant.** Every write in this skill is idempotent get-or-create matched by a natural key, exactly as in `rattle-apply-config` — a second run is a safe no-op.

## When to use this skill

- A new tenant has been provisioned, the API key works, and there is nothing in it yet.
- The user says "onboard", "set up", "getting started", "wie richte ich das ein", "Erstkonfiguration", "neuer Mandant" — or asks what to do first.
- A tenant exists but company settings, languages, or the base price list were never configured, and the first product is about to be created.
- The user is about to hand over a pricelist for a tenant that has no configuration at all — run this **before** `rattle-ingest`.

**Do not use this skill when the tenant already has products.** That is a *migration* (`rattle-ingest` → `rattle-suggest-config` → `rattle-apply-config`) or an *audit* (`rattle-audit`), not an onboarding. See "Before you start (preflight)".

## Before you start (preflight)

Two read-only calls. Both are mandatory, and the second one is a gate.

```
GET /api/v1/company            → CompanySettingsResponse (company_name, company_url,
                                 config_code_prefix, custom_domain, custom_domain_verified,
                                 default_language, id)
GET /api/v1/products?limit=1   → the gate
```

**If `GET /products` returns any product, STOP.** Do not "onboard" the tenant. An existing catalogue means the day-0 conventions below have *already been decided implicitly* by whoever created those products — the article-number key is already in some `integration_metadata` object, the currency is already baked into every price, the numbered-option unit is already baked into every `option_scalings` descriptor. Re-deciding them now silently forks the tenant into two conventions. Report what you found and route the user to `rattle-audit` (to see the state) or `rattle-ingest` (to add data), and stop.

Also read, before any write:

- `memory/<tenant>/profile.md` — if it already exists, the tenant is not new. Treat as above.
- `skills/rattle-configurator/SKILL.md` — the #1 rule governs the first product exactly as it governs the thousandth.

## The ordering rule that bites

> **The base price list MUST exist before any product is created.**

`ProductCreateRequest.currency` carries this description, verbatim from the spec:

> *"Accepted but ignored — currency is derived from the company's base price list"*

So a product created before the base price list exists is denominated by whatever the company falls back to — **not** by the `currency` you sent. You sent `"USD"`, you got `200 OK`, `ProductResponse.currency` reads back something else, and **nothing errored**. Every `base_price`, every `option.price`, every offer PDF downstream is now in the wrong currency, and the only signal is that a customer eventually notices the number is wrong.

This is the single reason day-0 order is not a matter of taste. `POST /price-lists {"name": …, "currency": "EUR", "is_base": true}` is **step 3**, before `POST /products` at **step 7**, and no shortcut around it exists. (Audit finding **P2-4**: *fields accepted, returned 200, and discarded*.)

**Never send `currency` on a product.** It is a lie you tell yourself. Set the currency once, on the base price list, and let every product derive it.

### The other findings that bite on day 0

Each of these is a decision you make **once**, on day 0, because it is baked into every row you import afterwards. They are drawn from `docs/API_AUDIT.md`; the consequence column is the point.

| Finding | The trap | Consequence if you get it wrong |
|---|---|---|
| **P2-1 — there is no `Product.sku`** | `ProductCreateRequest` accepts `base_price · catalog_meta · currency · description · integration_metadata · is_active · language · name`. **No `sku`, no `article_number`, on any product request or response.** The customer's article number — the join key to their ERP, the most universal column in the domain — has nowhere canonical to go. It must live in `integration_metadata.<key>`, and **`<key>` is a convention the tenant invents.** | Change the key later and **every product must be re-imported.** The field is unindexed (no lookup by article number) and unvalidated (no uniqueness), so nothing will tell you two products share one. Note `QuoteLineItemResponse.product_sku` **exists, read-only, with no writer anywhere in the API** — it renders `null` on every quote and there is nothing you can do about it. |
| **P2-4 — `currency` is silently ignored** | See above. | Every price in the tenant denominated wrong, with a `200 OK`. |
| **P0-1 — `X-Constraints-Version` is not in the spec** | `POST /constraints` **atomically replaces all** forbidden pairs for a product and documents an `X-Constraints-Version` OCC header **in its prose** — while declaring zero header parameters and no `409`. A spec-driven client is structurally incapable of sending it. | Two concurrent constraint writes: the second **silently destroys the first, with a `200 OK`.** The configurator starts selling combinations that cannot be built. Send the header from day 0 (`rattle-apply-config` § 6) — retry once on **409**, whose `detail` contains `Version conflict:`. |
| **P0-5 — `part_cost` is an `integer`** | `PartCreateRequest.part_cost` is `{"type": "integer", "minimum": 0}`. €12.50 **cannot be represented.** And `part_cost` rolls up through BOM explosion, so one rounded child poisons every ancestor. | Decide the money unit **now** — whole euros, or cents-as-integer. Across a 5,000-line BOM the difference is a real number on a real quote. Record it; every part import afterwards depends on it. |
| **P2-3 — numbered options are integer-only** | `number_min` / `number_max` / `number_step` are `integer`, and `ConfigurationCalculateRequest.option_amounts` is `{"additionalProperties": {"type": "integer"}}` — integer through the **entire** pipeline. **2.5 m, 0.5 kg, 1.75 m² are unrepresentable.** | If the customer sells anything by length, area, weight or volume, the only workaround is **unit inflation** (model in mm, divide back in the BOM factor). Decide mm-vs-m on day 0: it is baked into every `option_scalings` descriptor, the customer sees `3000` where they think `3 m`, and **off-by-1000 errors here are silent and quote-destroying.** |

## Workflow

Nine steps, in dependency order. Steps 1–3 and 5–7 write; steps 0, 4, 8, 9 do not touch the API. Every write is get-or-create by natural key.

### 0 · Preflight (read-only)

`GET /company`, `GET /products?limit=1`. **Refuse to onboard a tenant that already has products** — see above. Confirm `RATTLE_API_KEY_<TENANT>` resolves before anything else; an onboarding that dies halfway leaves a half-built tenant.

### 1 · Company — `PATCH /api/v1/company`

`CompanySettingsUpdateRequest` — **all four fields optional**, `additionalProperties: false`:

| Field | Constraint | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `company_name` | 1–255 chars | |
| `company_url` | ≤ 255 chars | |
| `config_code_prefix` | ≤ 10 chars | Prefixes every saved configuration code. Customer-visible. Pick it once — existing codes do not migrate. |
| `default_language` | ≤ 8 chars | The fallback language for entities created without an explicit `language`. Must match the base language you create in step 2. |

Idempotent: `GET /company` first, PATCH **only the fields that differ**.

### 2 · Languages — `POST /api/v1/languages`

`LanguageCreateRequest`: **required `code` (2–8 chars), `name` (1–50 chars)**; optional `is_base` (default `false`).

**Create the base language first**, with `is_base: true`. `default_language` on the company (step 1) should name the same language. A live tenant we probed carries `DE` + `EN-US` — the `code` is free-form within its length bounds, so **the tenant's spelling of the code is itself a convention**: `EN-US` and `en_US` are different strings to this API. Record which one you chose.

Natural key: `code`. `GET /api/v1/languages` (not paginated — it declares no `cursor`/`limit`) → skip if the code is present.

### 3 · Base price list — `POST /api/v1/price-lists` ← **BEFORE ANY PRODUCT**

`PriceListCreateRequest`: **required `name`**; optional `currency` (≤ 3 chars, default `"EUR"`), `description` (≤ 2000), `is_base` (default `false`).

```json
{"name": "Standard", "currency": "EUR", "is_base": true}
```

**`is_base: true` is the whole point of this step.** It is what every product's currency is derived from (see "The ordering rule that bites"). Exactly one base price list. Do this before step 7 or the tenant is silently wrong.

Natural key: `name`. Writes to `/price-lists/*` use the `X-Price-Lists-Version` OCC header — same discipline as constraints (`rattle-apply-config` § 6).

### 4 · Conventions — decide and RECORD (no API call)

The heart of the skill. **Stop and get an explicit human answer to each row of the table in "Decisions you must make on day 0" below.** Do not guess, do not default silently, do not proceed while any of them is open. They are written to `memory/<tenant>/profile.md` in step 9, and everything imported afterwards assumes them.

### 5 · Areas — `POST /api/v1/areas`

`AreaCreateRequest`: **required `name`** (1–255); optional `product_id`, `area_group_id`, `allow_disable` (default `false`), `description` (≤ 5000), `language` (default `"DE"`), `order_index`, `price` (default `"0.00"`).

Areas are the configurable sections of a product. **`product_id` is optional** — so an area can be created now, before the first product exists, and attached in step 7 via `POST /products/{productId}/areas`. Unattached areas are exactly what `GET /api/v1/areas/library` returns.

> **`GET /areas/library` is NOT a starter-template library.** Its own description: *"List areas not assigned to any product. Not paginated."* It is a **reuse pool of unattached areas** — on a fresh tenant it returns `[]`. (Verified: 0 on the live tenant.) Nothing seeds a new tenant with template areas. If a user expects starter content, tell them plainly that there is none.

Rule `no-empty-areas` applies from the first area: an area with zero groups is an audit `error`. Create areas here, fill them with groups in step 7 (or via `rattle-ingest` → `rattle-suggest-config`), and do not leave one empty.

### 6 · Configurator settings — `PATCH /api/v1/company/configurator-settings`

**19 flags that govern the entire customer-capture UX of the configurator** — whether a salesperson may create a new customer, which fields are shown, which are required, what the search box searches. A new tenant must decide them **deliberately**; the defaults are not a design.

> **These flags are not in the OpenAPI spec.** The `PATCH`/`PUT` request body is an **inline** `{"type": "object", "additionalProperties": true}` — no schema, no field names, no validation. **An agent cannot discover them.** That is precisely why this skill lists them. Full contract, defaults, and the UX consequence of each: **`references/configurator-settings.md`**.

The 19, verified against a live tenant: `allow_create_new_customer`, `allow_select_existing_customer`, `customer_search_fields` (array), `start_search_digits` (int), `require_company_contact_person`, `require_customer_address`, `require_customer_contact_person`, `require_customer_email`, `require_customer_id`, `require_customer_info`, `require_customer_organization`, `require_customer_phone`, `show_company_contact_person`, `show_customer_address`, `show_customer_contact_person`, `show_customer_email`, `show_customer_id`, `show_customer_organization`, `show_customer_phone`.

Idempotent: `GET /company/configurator-settings` first, PATCH only what differs. Because the body is `additionalProperties: true`, **a typo'd flag name is accepted with a `200` and does nothing** — there is no `422` to protect you. Verify by reading the settings back.

### 7 · First product — `POST /api/v1/products`

`ProductCreateRequest`: **only `name` is required** (1–255). Optional: `base_price` (string|integer|number, default `"0.00"`), `description` (≤ 5000), `is_active` (default `true`), `language` (default `"DE"`), `catalog_meta`, `integration_metadata` — and `currency`, **which you must never send** (it is accepted and discarded).

The article number goes in `integration_metadata` under the key decided in step 4:

```json
{
  "name": "Widget Pro",
  "base_price": "12000.00",
  "language": "DE",
  "integration_metadata": {"article_number": "WP-1000"}
}
```

Then attach the step-5 areas: `POST /api/v1/products/{productId}/areas`.

**Now hand off.** Do not hand-build the configuration. The customer's pricelist goes to **`rattle-ingest`**, which maps its columns onto entities and — critically — **refuses to invent a standard variant that the pricelist does not state** (the `#1 rule`, enforced at the door). The chain from here is `rattle-ingest` → `rattle-pricelist-analysis` → `rattle-suggest-config` → `rattle-apply-config`.

Groups and options, when they come, obey: `GroupCreateRequest` requires `name` (`area_id` optional); `OptionCreateRequest` requires **`name` and `group_id`**.

### 8 · Baseline audit — `rattle-audit`

Run the 6 structural checks against the result:

```
python skills/rattle-audit/scripts/audit_runner.py <tenant>
```

A day-0 tenant should be clean. If it is not, the two you will actually see are `areas-without-groups` (you created an area in step 5 and never filled it) and `offer-template-missing-configuration` (if a template was built). Fix them now, while the catalogue is one product deep and a mistake costs minutes. This is the baseline every later audit is compared against.

### 9 · Tenant memory — write `memory/<tenant>/profile.md`

Persist **every decision from step 4**, plus the currency, base language and `config_code_prefix` from steps 1–3. This file is auto-injected into every downstream system prompt (`rattle-tenant-memory`), so a convention recorded here is a convention every later session honours — and a convention *not* recorded here is one the next session will silently re-invent.

Per `rattle-tenant-memory`, **writes are explicit-only** — show the user the file you intend to write and get consent. Onboarding is the one workflow where writing a profile is expected, not exceptional.

```markdown
# acme — tenant preferences

## Conventions (decided at onboarding, 2026-07-14)
- **article-number-key**: `integration_metadata.article_number`
- **part-cost-unit**: whole EUR (part_cost is integer — API cannot hold cents)
- **numbered-option-unit**: mm (length options modelled in mm; BOM factor divides by 1000)
- **custom-keys**: never
- **base-currency**: EUR (from base price list "Standard")
- **base-language**: DE (config_code_prefix: ACME)

## Preferences
- **custom-keys**: never
- **option-standard-variant**: always present, price 0, recommended=true
```

The `## Preferences` section is parsed by `set_preference()` and `validate_recommendation.py` for `- **<key>**: <value>` lines — keep `custom-keys` there in that exact shape. The `## Conventions` section is free-form prose the consultant reads.

## Decisions you must make on day 0

The conventions table. Each row is a decision that is **cheap now and expensive later**, because the API gives you no place to change it and no error when it drifts.

| Decision | What it is | Why day 0 | What breaks if you change it later | Where it gets recorded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Article-number key** | The key inside `product.integration_metadata` that holds the customer's article number / SKU / Sachnummer. E.g. `integration_metadata.article_number`. | **There is no `Product.sku`** (P2-1). The most universal column in any pricelist has no canonical home, so the tenant must invent one — and every import, every ERP sync, and every lookup depends on the same string. | **Every product must be re-imported.** The field is unindexed and unvalidated: nothing detects the drift, and a second integrator picking `integration_metadata.sku` produces a tenant where half the catalogue is invisible to the other half's queries. | `memory/<tenant>/profile.md` § Conventions, as `article-number-key` |
| **Money unit for `part_cost`** | Whether an integer `part_cost` means whole euros or cents. | `part_cost` is an `integer` with **no documented unit** (P0-5). €12.50 is unrepresentable either way; you are choosing which rounding error you accept. | Costs roll up through BOM explosion, so **switching the unit silently rescales every ancestor part by 100×.** No error, no warning — just a quote that is 100× wrong. | `memory/<tenant>/profile.md` § Conventions, as `part-cost-unit` |
| **Numeric unit for numbered options** | mm vs m, g vs kg, cm² vs m² — the unit a numbered option's integer amount is expressed in. | Numbered options are **integer-only, end to end** (P2-3). Anything continuous (cut-to-length, sheet goods, cable, textiles) needs unit inflation, and the inflation factor is not stored anywhere in the API. | The factor is baked into **every `option_scalings` descriptor and every BOM factor** already written. Changing it means rewriting all of them. Meanwhile `number_unit` becomes a lie relative to the customer's mental model — they think `3 m`, the field says `3000`. | `memory/<tenant>/profile.md` § Conventions, as `numbered-option-unit` |
| **Custom keys: yes or no** | Whether groups and options carry a `key` (both accept one, default `""`). | Keys are for ERP joins. A tenant that sets them must set them **consistently from the first option**; a tenant that does not want them must say so, or an agent will helpfully add them. | Half-keyed catalogues cannot be joined. The `options-with-custom-keys` audit check is **opt-in via tenant memory** — without the recorded preference it does not run, so nobody is told. | `memory/<tenant>/profile.md` § **Preferences**, as `- **custom-keys**: never` (this exact shape is parsed by `validate_recommendation.py`) |
| **Base currency** | The currency of the base price list. | Every product derives its currency from it (P2-4). The `currency` field on a product is accepted and discarded. | Products created before the base price list exists are **already denominated wrong**, and no error was raised. Fixing it means re-creating them. | The base price list itself (step 3) + `profile.md` § Conventions |
| **Base language + `default_language`** | The `is_base: true` language and the company's `default_language`. Also the exact spelling of the code (`EN-US` vs `en_US`). | Every entity has a `language` (default `"DE"`). Entities created before the base language exists inherit the fallback. | Mixed-language catalogues where half the entities carry a code that matches nothing. `code` is a free-form string of 2–8 chars — nothing normalises it. | Steps 1–2 + `profile.md` § Conventions |
| **`config_code_prefix`** | ≤ 10 chars, prefixes every saved configuration code. Customer-visible. | Configuration codes are handed to end customers and quoted back to support. | **Existing codes do not migrate.** You get two generations of code in the wild and no way to tell which is which. | Step 1 + `profile.md` § Conventions |

## Output contract

Onboarding emits one report. Same shape as `rattle-apply-config` (`applied` / `skipped` / `errors`), plus the three things only a day-0 run produces: the preflight verdict, the conventions, and the baseline audit.

```json

**Onboarding-tier operations.** Six `ensure_*` types, all idempotent get-or-create by natural key:

| Operation | Natural key | REST |
|---|---|---|
| `ensure_company_settings` | singleton (the company) | `GET /company` → `PATCH /company` with only the differing fields |
| `ensure_language` | `code` | `GET /languages` (not paginated) → `POST /languages` |
| `ensure_price_list` | `name` | `GET /price-lists` → `POST /price-lists`. Exactly one `is_base: true`. |
| `ensure_configurator_settings` | singleton (the company) | `GET /company/configurator-settings` → `PATCH /company/configurator-settings`. **No schema validation — read back to verify.** |
| `ensure_area` | `name` | `GET /areas?search=<name>` → `POST /areas`; attach via `POST /products/{productId}/areas` |
| `ensure_product` | `name` | `GET /products?search=<name>` → `POST /products`. **Never send `currency`.** |

`ensure_area` and `ensure_product` are the same operations `rattle-apply-config` defines — identical semantics, identical natural keys. The first four are new in this tier and are executed by the `rattle-onboarder` agent, not by `rattle-config-builder`.

## Handing off

```
rattle-onboarding      empty tenant → company, languages, base price list,
                       conventions, areas, settings, first product   ← you are here
  └→ rattle-ingest             the customer's pricelist → source-mapping.json + normalized rows
       └→ rattle-pricelist-analysis   → anti-pattern findings
            └→ rattle-suggest-config  → recommendation.json
                 └→ rattle-apply-config   → idempotent ensure_* writes
  └→ rattle-audit              baseline: the 6 structural checks (step 8)
  └→ rattle-tenant-memory      profile.md with every day-0 decision (step 9)
```

- **Never skip step 3 to get to step 7 faster.** The currency trap is silent and it is the reason this skill exists.
- **Do not hand-build the customer's configuration** after step 7. `rattle-ingest` exists so that a missing standard variant becomes a **blocker**, not an invented option. An onboarding that guesses the standard variant has already violated the `#1 rule`.
- **A BOM comes last.** `rattle-bom-builder` / `rattle-bom-architect` need options to hang `usage_subclauses` on; they cannot run before the configuration exists.
- **Document templates come last too.** An `offer` template must attach `dynamic:document_configuration`; a `quote` template must attach `dynamic:document_line_items`. `GET /documents/doc-types` returns the registry. See `rattle-document-templates`.
